# What is this project?
This project was made with the purpose of learning new things through the learning process of "Project based learning". 
While I learnt from the previous projects that solo man standing won't make me go far. So I decided to invite a game programmer and game designer. (Thanks, KillerScrubbiz and Bookito)
By doing these, I and my team can learn to work outside comfortable zone and practise time and priority management.

# Why do I do this project?
In most simple word, Learning from experience. Nothing else.
I did not even care if I get to win. I just want to have fun learning. 

# How did I do this project?
The overall project went well. Sure, there are some struggles but we dealt with it.
Most of the time, I was spending it doing the gameplay. The codes are not so perfect as there is speed limit bound to it.
But I tried my best doing them as clean and fast as possible. 


# List of thing I learn during the project development.
- List

- Observer Pattern
- For Looping
- Simple Animator (Just know that it can be develop in separate scene)
